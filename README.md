# RevelatorModKit
This is a script mod manager/script extractor for Guilty Gear Xrd -REVELATOR-.  Supports normal and Etc files so far.

## Mod Manager Instructions
1. Open the game.
2. If this is the first time running the mod manager, the program will ask you to specify a folder for all your modded files.  New folder highly reccomended.
3. Once the main window opens you will see the script extractor (for modders) and the mod manager.  Don't check any character box unless you have the file installed in the directory you specified in step 2.
4. To enable mods, right before the interlude/loading screen in your mode of choice, check "Enable Mods".  Any later and it won't work.
5. Load up/ready up and play!  Enjoy your mods.
